# Perl Mnemonic C API

Idea of this header file came up to me when i've started to dig perlguts the 
first time. 

Documented API is really invonvenient for a newcomers, hard to remember, 
easy to make a mistake and hard to find one. In my personal opinion it's 
very bad when so many methods differs from each other by one letter.

Don't really know what is behind such names, probably some ancient 
development tools without autocomplete, or just a bad style.

So, here is my attempt to make it easier for myself and, probably, for other 
perl diggers.

Of course, the main purpose is to make writing extensions easier.
